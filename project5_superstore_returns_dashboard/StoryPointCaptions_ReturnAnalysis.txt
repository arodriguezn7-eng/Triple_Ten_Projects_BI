Tableau Story Point Captions – Customer Returns Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Slide 1 – “Where Are Returns Coming From?”
Returns vary significantly by geography, with states like California and Texas showing high return rates. This map highlights where the Superstore is experiencing the most issues — a starting point for root cause analysis.

2. Slide 2 – “When Are Returns Peaking?”
Return rates spike notably in late Summer and following the holiday season. This seasonal pattern suggests that gift-related purchases may be a key driver of returns and should be examined more closely.

3. Slide 3 – “What’s Getting Returned?”
Certain product categories such as Chairs, Tables, and Binders are returned more frequently, especially in high-volume states. This heatmap points to the intersection of product issues and regional trends.

4. Slide 4 – “Summary & Recommendations”
Returns are driven by seasonal surges, product category weaknesses, and regional fulfillment challenges. To reduce returns, the Superstore should improve post-holiday inventory handling, review product quality in key sub-categories, and focus on high-return regions.
